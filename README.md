# Unicode-keyboard
This application will display a virtual keyboard where you can enter all characters of the Unicode character set and save the entered characters to file, update and retrieve files. The user can optionally use encodings (regular) utf8, utf16 and modified utf8. When retrieving a file the application will check which encoding to use via the BOM.
